Godot Pixel Theme
Version: 1.0

Thanks for purchasing my Pixel UI Theme for Godot 3.

Along with this readme, you should find the following files:

8x8_ui_elements.png	This spritesheet/textureatlas are the various textures for the StyleBoxTextures for the various controls such as buttons, panels, etc.
8x8_ui_icons.png		These are a bunch of 8x8 pixel size UI Icons which is included in this asset.
PixelTheme.tres		This is the theme file - plop it onto your main control, or set it in Project Settings (gui/theme/custom) or just search for 'Theme' in the Project -> Project Settings dialogue.

# Customization
If you'd like to customize the theme, you may duplicate the PixelTheme.tres file by right-clicking it.
Alternatively, you can easily open the 8x8_ui_elements.png file in your favorite image editor such as Photoshop/Gimp/Krita and add a color layer using a 'Color' or 'Overlay' blend mode.

If you have any problems, or have feature requests, don't hesitate to comment on the itch.io page.

# License
You can use it for commercial and non-commercial work, for as many projects as you want. Please don't redistribute or resell the theme, though!

Thank you
