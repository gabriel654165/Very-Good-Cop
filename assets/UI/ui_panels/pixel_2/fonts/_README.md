# Nb Pixel Font Bundle
> The only pixel-font bundle you will ever need.

Tired of searching forever for pixel fonts with the correct license and a good look?
Your search has come to an end. 

This bundle contains 20 public domain fonts which you can use, modify, distribute in personal and commercial projects without attribution.​
It's spiritual successor of the '[magos free pixel font bundle](https://nimblebeastscollective.itch.io/magosfonts)' released some years ago.


# ​Font Base Sizes

​All fonts included do have a base 16-pixel size. Only TinyPixie2 deviates from this. That has a size of 12 pixels.
